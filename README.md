OSCMouse
===

This is a mouse movement server built to be used with X11 and TouchOSC. It was a simple utility written by me while playing with `liblo` and `OSC`.

To use it type `make` followed by `./oscmouse <screen-width> <screen-height>`. This will run the server on port `8000` which you can connect to via [TouchOSC](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.hexler.touchosc).
